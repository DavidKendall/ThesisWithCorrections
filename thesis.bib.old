@Article{HSAUAPPRFM11,
  abstract =	 {Foraging is a common benchmark problem in collective
                  robotics in which a robot (the forager) explores a
                  given environment while collecting items for further
                  deposition at specific locations. A typical
                  real-world application of foraging is garbage
                  collection where robots collect garbage for further
                  disposal in pre-defined locations.  This work
                  proposes a method to cooperatively perform the task
                  of finding such locations: instead of using local or
                  global localization strategies relying on
                  pre-installed infrastructure, the proposed approach
                  takes advantage of the knowledge gathered by a
                  population about the localization of the targets. In
                  our approach, robots communicate in an intrinsic way
                  the estimation about how near they are from a
                  target; these estimations are used by neighbour
                  robots for estimating their proximity, and for
                  guiding the navigation of the whole population when
                  looking for these specific areas. We performed
                  several tests in a simulator, and we validated our
                  approach on a population of real robots. For the
                  validation tests we used a mobile robot called
                  marXbot. In both cases (i.e., simulation and
                  implementation on real robots), we found that the
                  proposed approach efficiently guides the robots
                  towards the pre-specified targets while allowing the
                  modulation of their speed.},

                  developed for autonomous formation flying,
                  communication, and task assignment for cooperating
                  unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Dudek's taxonomy
                  was used to evaluate the performance of the
                  autonomous UAV group cooperating in mission
                  execution against a group of enemy agents in an
                  unknown environment. The authors showed that
                  increasing the number of UAVs in the group proves to
                  be beneficial as it allows the group to react to
                  more enemy events, even if the overall search and
                  detect capabilities remain invariant with the number
                  of UAVs. It is also showed that, in general, using
                  communication improves the cooperation among the
                  flock members; however, using infinite communication
                  range or infinite communication bandwidth results in
                  considerable computational complexity. In
                  conclusion, it is sufficient to use finite-bandwidth
                  communication, keeping the computational complexity
                  constant with the number of UAVs in the group, thus
                  allowing the group to be scalable to large numbers
                  of UAVs. The authors use a behavioural flocking
                  algorithm to control the movement of the UAVs when
                  searching, and show that flocking assists the UAVs
                  in dispersing in the environment and improves the
                  overall detection probability of the flock. Finally,
                  it is showed that using flocking improves the group
                  performance only if the group is capable of mission
                  task collaboration.},
