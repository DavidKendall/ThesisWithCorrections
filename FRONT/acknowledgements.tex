I would like to thank my Mother for the mantra of `Keep on learning!' I will be forever grateful.

I would like to thank my Wife who is both an inspiration and a pillar to my existence, without her there would be no me!

I would also like to thank my Supervisory team (Dr David Kendall, Dr Michael Brockway and Prof. Ahmed Bouridane) without whom none of this would have been possible. I hope that the University appreciate their dedication to teaching and research and bestow upon them sabbaticals and research time so they may influence others as they have influenced me.

I would also like to thank others who have influenced me at different stages in my life, to mention but a few, Bill (William) Henderson, John Eakins and Adrian Robson and from secondary school Mr (Dominic) James an inspirational teacher!
